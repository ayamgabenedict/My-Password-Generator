## Contributions

1. Refactored the code for optimization such as:
   1. Memoization with the `useCallback`: Wrapped the <b>copyPasswordToClipboard</b> with the `useCallback` hook to prevent unnecessary re-renders when its corresponding dependency hadn't changed.
   2. Improved CSS for more UX ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š
